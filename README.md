## Personal Website – [miiaz.xyz](https://miiaz.xyz)

This repository contains the source files for my personal portfolio website. It also serves as a sandbox for experimenting with basic HTML and CSS.

Most of the site assets (images, PDFs, STL files, etc.) have been excluded to keep the repository lightweight.
If you’d like to see the full site in action, visit [miiaz.xyz](https://miiaz.xyz).

**Notes:**
- All file paths assume the site is hosted from the **root directory** and may need updating
- This repo is a work in progress and meant for personal version control - but feel free to use it for reference if it can come in handy :)
